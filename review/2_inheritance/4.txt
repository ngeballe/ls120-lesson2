What is the method lookup path and how is it important?

It's the chain of classes and modules that Ruby uses to look up methods called on an object. It goes:

1. Object's class
2. modules included in the class, from last created in the code to first
3. Superclass (the class that the object's class inherits from)
4. modules included in the superclass
